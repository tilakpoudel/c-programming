# Structure
In C programming, a structure is a user-defined data type that allows the grouping of variables of different types 
under a single name. Structures are useful when you need to store information about different properties of an 
entity that may vary in type (such as integers, floats, and characters).

Syntax of Structure in C
```
struct structure_name {
    data_type1 variable1;
    data_type2 variable2;
    ...
};
struct: Keyword used to define the structure.
structure_name: The name of the structure.
data_type: Any valid C data type (e.g., int, float, char).
variable: Variable names of different types within the structure.
