    #define CELSIUS_TO_FAHRENHEIT(c) ((c) * 9.0 / 5.0 + 32)  // Conversion macro
    #define CELSIUS_TO_KELVIN(c) ((c) + 273.15)  // Conversion macro
    ```

## Lab3
### Objective(s):
To understand the programming knowledge using Decision Statements (if, if-else, if-
else if ladder, switch and GOTO)

order.
4.  Write a program that asks a number and test the number whether it is multiple of 5 or not,
divisible by 7 but not by eleven.
5.  Write a program to check whether the entered year is leap year or not (a year is leap if it
is divisible by 4 and divisible by 100 or 400.)
6.  Write a program to read the values of coefficients a, b and c of a quadratic equation
ax2+bx+c=0 and find roots of the equation.
